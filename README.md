# Part 1 - Form

## Description
Just a simple Mockup with no functionality. All commands can of course be used with yarn.

## Installation
```bash
npm install
```

## Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Preview
```
npm run build && npm run serve
```

## Suggestions and Remarks
Because we only want a Mockup, there is no cross browser support or responsive design. So some things will likely look different depending on the browser you're using. This Mockup has been created using Google Chrome with a resolution of 768x1024.

Accessibility is important and this only becomes more true in the years to come. So this form is basically accessible by screen readers. You can properly tab through them.
If I had the need to implement these functionalities myself, because of strict style guide for example. This might take some time. But there're great documentations about what counts as accessible.

I actually like the default styling Chrome gives us, so I didn't change much of it.
